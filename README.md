### Commands
`W`: Move foward

`S`: Move backward

`A`: Strafe left

`D`: Strafe right

`Left Arrow`: Rotate the camera to the left

`Right Arrow`: Rotate the camera to the right

In the bonus we also have:

`Spacebar or Left Mouse Button`: Fire a projectile

`E`: Open/Close doors

### Maps
Cub3D will read files with the `.cub` extension as maps.

A map will define the in-game layout, sprites and colors

It will define the sprites for every side of the wall: `NO`, `SO`, `WE`, `EA`.

The colors for the floor, `F`, and ceiling, `C` in rgb format.

The last it is the in-game layout, `1` for walls, `0` for path.

It will also have the player spwan: `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`. The player will spwan looking at one direction wich is represent by the letter.

Map example:
```bash
NO ./sprites/north_wall.xpm
SO ./sprites/south_wall.xpm
WE ./sprites/wall.xpm
EA ./sprites/east_wall.xpm
F 255,255,255
C 0,0,0

1000E001
10010001
10000101
10000001
11111111
```

In the bonus part we have more representing the in-game layout like, `D` for closed doors, `C` for coins, `e` for enemies, `H` for collectible hearts and `P` for closed special doors.

Map bonus Example:
```bash
WE ./sprites/wall3.xpm
NO ./sprites/wall3.xpm
SO ./sprites/wall3.xpm
EA ./sprites/wall3.xpm
C 0,0,0
F 123,123,123
